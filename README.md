1st assessment of the Springboard curriculum

1. Call countDown(num) in the console to count down from num to 0

2. Call randomGame() in the console to see how many times it takes to randomly generate a number between 0-1 that is greater than .75. randomGame() runs every 1 second and keeps track of how many times it runs before ending, and logs that number.
